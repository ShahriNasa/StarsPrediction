Repository Structure
1. LightCurveData/
This folder contains Python scripts designed to fetch data from the Kepler Light Curve dataset efficiently using parallel processing. It also includes modules for cleaning and preprocessing the data, tailored to various star properties.

2. Star&Beyond/
This folder provides the tools necessary for splitting and preparing the data for neural network models. Inside, you'll find:

1D CNN and RCNN Models: Code to train your model using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks.
Transfer Learning: Leverage pre-trained models for transfer learning.
Automated Grid Search: Easily experiment with hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search for different time periods (27 or 97 days of data).
Sample Data: A small dataset is included for quick training and testing purposes.
